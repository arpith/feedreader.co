<p>I'm building an alternative to <a href=reader.google.com>Google Reader</a>. A <a href=https://twitter.com/search?q=google%20reader>quick search</a> gives an idea of how many apps depend on its (<a href=google.com/search?q=google+reader+api>unofficial?</a>) API and how deeply users care about feed reading. We need an alternative that is fast and reliable, values privacy and maintains a buyer-seller relationship with each user. It makes sense to pay a fee to access a service. It's also a sound business model, to charge users a fee and not spend it all. You are my target customer if you use Google Reader and value it.</p>
<p>Interested?  You should follow me on <a href='http://twitter.com/arpith'>Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>I have built a <a href=/api>feed syncing api</a> and I'm currently testing it by building a <a href=/arpith/labels/unread>front end feed aggregator</a>. I've been working on this for six months now, and to my knowledge no one else is as interested in this problem. Previously I obtained a masters in computer science and an honours degree in physics. Perhaps all that theory will come in handy.</p>
